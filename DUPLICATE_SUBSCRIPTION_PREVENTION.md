# Duplicate Subscription Prevention

## 🚨 Issue Addressed

**Problem**: Users could potentially create multiple subscriptions by:
- Using different email addresses
- Creating accounts before payment validation
- Exploiting race conditions in the checkout process

**Impact**: 
- Revenue loss from duplicate subscriptions
- Customer confusion and support issues
- Potential abuse of trial periods

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Multi-Layer Protection

1. **Email-based customer lookup** - Check if customer already exists
2. **Active subscription validation** - Prevent creation if active subscription exists
3. **Pending subscription validation** - Handle incomplete subscriptions
4. **Early detection** - Check at payment intent creation stage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Customer Lookup by Email

```javascript
// In create-payment-intent.js and create-subscription.js
const existingCustomers = await stripe.customers.list({
  email: email,
  limit: 1
});

if (existingCustomers.data.length > 0) {
  customer = existingCustomers.data[0];
  // Use existing customer instead of creating new one
}
```

### 2. Active Subscription Check

```javascript
const existingSubscriptions = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
  customer: customer.id,
  status: 'active',
  limit: 100
});

if (existingSubscriptions.data.length > 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Customer already has an active subscription',
    existingSubscriptionId: existingSubscriptions.data[0].id
  });
}
```

### 3. Pending Subscription Check

```javascript
const pendingSubscriptions = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
  customer: customer.id,
  status: 'incomplete',
  limit: 100
});

if (pendingSubscriptions.data.length > 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Customer has a pending subscription that needs to be completed first',
    pendingSubscriptionId: pendingSubscriptions.data[0].id
  });
}
```

## 📊 Validation Flow

### Payment Intent Creation
1. **Check if customer exists** by email
2. **If exists**: Check for active/pending subscriptions
3. **If active subscription**: Return error immediately
4. **If pending subscription**: Return error with instructions
5. **If no subscription**: Proceed with payment intent creation

### Subscription Creation
1. **Use existing customer** if found by email
2. **Check for active subscriptions** again (double-check)
3. **Check for pending subscriptions** again
4. **Create subscription** only if no conflicts

## 🎨 User Experience

### Error Messages
