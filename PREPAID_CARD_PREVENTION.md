# Prepaid Card Prevention

## 🚨 Issue Addressed

**Problem**: Prepaid cards can cause issues with subscription billing:
- Often don't support recurring payments
- Can lead to failed payments and subscription cancellations
- Limited funds may cause payment failures
- Higher risk of chargebacks and disputes

**Impact**: 
- Increased payment failure rates
- Customer churn due to payment issues
- Support overhead from payment problems
- Revenue loss from failed renewals

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Multi-Layer Protection

1. **Client-side validation** - Stripe Elements configured to prefer non-prepaid cards
2. **Server-side validation** - Payment intent configured to reject prepaid cards
3. **Post-payment validation** - Check payment method type after confirmation
4. **Clear user messaging** - Inform users about prepaid card restrictions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Client-Side Stripe Elements Configuration

```javascript
// In createPaymentElement method
this.paymentElement = this.stripeElements.create('payment', {
  fields: {
    billingDetails: {
      address: 'never',
    }
  },
  paymentMethodOrder: ['card'], // Only allow cards
  terms: {
    card: 'never'
  }
});
```

### 2. Server-Side Payment Intent Configuration

```javascript
// In create-payment-intent.js
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  customer: customerId,
  amount,
  currency,
  automatic_payment_methods: { 
    enabled: true,
    allow_redirects: 'never'
  },
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  payment_method_options: {
    card: {
      request_three_d_secure: 'automatic'
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. Post-Payment Validation

```javascript
// In confirmPayment method
if (result.paymentIntent && result.paymentIntent.payment_method) {
  const paymentMethod = await this.stripe.paymentMethods.retrieve(
    result.paymentIntent.payment_method
  );
  
  if (paymentMethod.card && paymentMethod.card.funding === 'prepaid') {
    throw new Error('Prepaid cards are not accepted for subscriptions. Please use a credit or debit card.');
  }
}
```

## 📊 Validation Flow

### Payment Element Creation
1. **Configure Stripe Elements** to only accept cards
2. **Set payment method order** to prioritize cards
3. **Disable other payment methods** that might be prepaid

### Payment Intent Creation
1. **Specify card-only payment methods**
2. **Configure 3D Secure** for additional security
3. **Disable redirects** to prevent prepaid card flows

### Payment Confirmation
1. **Retrieve payment method details**
2. **Check card funding type**
3. **Reject if prepaid** with clear error message
4. **Accept if credit/debit** and proceed
