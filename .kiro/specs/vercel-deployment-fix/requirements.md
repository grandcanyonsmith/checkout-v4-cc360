# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Course Creator 360 checkout application needs to be properly configured for deployment on Vercel. Currently, the deployment fails because Vercel cannot find the expected "public" directory after the build process completes. The application has static files in the root directory and uses Express.js as a server, but lacks proper Vercel configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to deploy successfully on Vercel, so that the checkout page is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL organize static files appropriately for Vercel deployment
2. WHEN Vercel looks for output files THEN the system SHALL provide them in the expected directory structure
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible via the Vercel URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Vercel configuration, so that the Express.js server and static files are handled correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel processes the deployment THEN the system SHALL use appropriate configuration for Express.js serverless functions
2. WHEN static files are requested THEN Vercel SHALL serve them directly without going through the Express server
3. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN they SHALL be handled by the Express.js application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper build process, so that the application is prepared correctly for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script runs THEN the system SHALL copy static files to the appropriate output directory
2. WHEN the build completes THEN all necessary files SHALL be in their correct locations for Vercel deployment
3. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured for the Vercel environment
