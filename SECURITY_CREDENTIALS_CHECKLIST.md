# Security Credentials Checklist

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS COMPLETED

1. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - ‚úÖ Created `.env` file with actual credentials
   - ‚úÖ Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore` and properly ignored by git

2. **Credential Security**
   - ‚úÖ Moved sensitive keys from code to environment variables
   - ‚úÖ Used proper environment variable structure

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **IMMEDIATE - Rotate Compromised Keys**
Since these credentials were shared in plain text, you MUST rotate them immediately:

**Stripe Keys:**
- [ ] Log into Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Generate new publishable key
- [ ] Generate new secret key  
- [ ] Update webhook endpoint with new secret
- [ ] Update `.env` file with new keys

**Twilio Keys:**
- [ ] Log into Twilio Console
- [ ] Generate new Auth Token
- [ ] Update `.env` file with new token

### 2. **Production Environment Setup**
- [ ] Set up environment variables in your production platform (Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Never use live keys in development
- [ ] Use test keys for development/testing

### 3. **Access Control**
- [ ] Review who has access to these credentials
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Consider using a secrets management service

## üõ°Ô∏è BEST PRACTICES

### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Use `.env` for local development
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` as template (no real keys)
- ‚úÖ Use platform environment variables in production
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files to git

### Key Management
- [ ] Use different keys for development/staging/production
- [ ] Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)
- [ ] Monitor key usage for suspicious activity
- [ ] Use least privilege principle

### Code Security
- [ ] Never hardcode credentials in source code
- [ ] Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- [ ] Validate environment variables on startup
- [ ] Log security events (but never log credentials)

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If credentials are compromised:
1. **Stripe**: Contact support immediately
2. **Twilio**: Contact support immediately
3. **Rotate all keys immediately**
4. **Review access logs for suspicious activity**

## üìã REGULAR MAINTENANCE

- [ ] Monthly: Review who has access to credentials
- [ ] Quarterly: Rotate all API keys
- [ ] Quarterly: Review security logs
- [ ] Annually: Security audit of credential management
